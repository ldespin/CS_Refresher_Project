To run the program:

Open the main.py file.
First select a set of trajectories, giving the path of the repertory to the variable "set".
We can change the value of the K parameter, to change the subidivision of the space of trajectories.

Run the main.py file.

The output will be the reconstructed trajectories.

You can also uncomment line 59 to plot the initial trajectories, or the line 66 to show the points that permit to reconstruct the trajectories.
